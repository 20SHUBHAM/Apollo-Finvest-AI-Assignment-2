## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone 
cd loan-recovery-system
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Application (`app.py`)
Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials in `app.py`:
```python
SECRET_KEY = "your_flask_secret_key_here"
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = "your_twilio_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_twilio_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = "+1234567890"
AI_CALL_API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/your_twilio_account_sid/Calls.json"
PAYMENT_LINK_BASE_URL = "https://yourpaymentgateway.com/pay/"
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Your Flask app will run at: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🌐 Exposing Local Server with Ngrok (Optional)

To test Twilio integration locally, expose your server using Ngrok:

1. Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and install Ngrok.
2. Authenticate Ngrok:
    ```bash
    ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN
    ```
3. Run Ngrok:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
4. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by Ngrok and configure it in your Twilio Console as webhook URL.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Application

- Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000/
```
- Enter borrower details and initiate a call.
- Verify call initiation via Twilio logs and SMS delivery.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in production environments.
- Use environment variables or secure secret management services.
- Always ensure HTTPS communication in production deployments.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate a robust database system (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Implement user authentication and access management.
- Expand multi-language conversational support.
- Direct integration with payment gateways for seamless repayments.
